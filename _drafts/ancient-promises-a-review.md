_A non-cliche love story_

A story of love, heartbreaks and marriage, Indian author Jaishree Misra's beautiful narration is nothing but a perfect romantic and coming-of-age novel. It has interesting plot twists which keeps the readers gripped. Janaki, the heroine is a representative of the typical Indian woman whose life gets altered and faulted through marriage and family life. 

I was really glad that I came across this book. I actually bought it because it was prescribed in our third year syllabus. My opinion about Indian English literature changed for the good after reading Ancient Promises. I realized that there are talented English authors in India. The setting of the novel is mostly a small fictional town in Kerala. 

This is a heartrending story of love and family loyalty. The book brings out significant themes of the difficulties of differently abled children. The book is about Janaki's life from teenager to adulthood. It's about her lost love, early marriage and her brave step to find happiness. Her miserable life makes her stronger and she finds courage to make things better. 

I almost like everything about the book including the attractive cover design.
