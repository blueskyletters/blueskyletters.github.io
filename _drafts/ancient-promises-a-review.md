_A non-cliche love story_

A story of love, heartbreaks and marriage, Indian author Jaishree Misra's beautiful narration is nothing but a perfect romantic and coming-of-age novel. It has interesting plot twists which keeps the readers gripped. Janaki, the heroine is a representative of the typical Indian woman whose life gets altered and faulted through marriage and family life. 

I was really glad that I came across this book. I actually bought it because it was prescribed in our third year syllabus. My opinion about Indian English literature changed for the good after reading Ancient Promises. I realized that there are talented English authors in India. The setting of the novel is mostly a small fictional town in Kerala. 

This is a heartrending story of love and family loyalty.
