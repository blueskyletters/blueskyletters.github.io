A fiction book that expresses the most complex life lessons in a subtle way

> _“Beginnings could happen more than once, or in different ways.” -_Rachel Joyce, _The Unexpected Pilgrimage of Harold Fry_

Before I go into the review, let me tell you how I discovered this book. I was mesmerized by the book _A Man Called Ove_ by Frederik Backman. Who wouldn't? A realistically heart-warming story that makes one cry and laugh at the same time. So I wanted to find a book that had such a simple, beautiful yet powerful story. Google gave me a couple of recommendations and _The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry_ was one of them. If you loved Ove, then I would definitely recommend you to take a walk with Harold. 

I loved the purity and unique beauty of this uplifting tale. At first I wondered how I could possibly get involved in this apparently absurd story.  But it was a quick read and full of pleasant surprises and many special moments. One fine morning, a retired old man Harold Fry sets out to post a letter to his old colleague and friend, Queenie, who suffers from a grave illness. But he spontaneously decides to head-off in her far away direction. And so Mr. Fry ends up setting out on a 500 mile walk to visit his friend.

What I loved the most about this book is its simplicity; the hero is not a rich and good-looking guy...he's just a person with flaws like you and me; the plot isn't complicated and the author doesn't give you a hard time with unbreakable words. It's an unembellished story of an ordinary man who embarks on the journey of a lifetime. 

_The Unexpected Pilgrimage of Harold Fry_ an introspective story and deals with a lot of issues quietly. Rachel Joyce expresses the most complex life lessons in subtle ways. At times, it felt like I was reading a non-fiction book with lots of valuable insights. Such was its power- one of the few books that I felt has a great touch with reality and the bitter-sweet nature of life in general. It will strike a chord with lots of people. This is the kind of book that would be best for discussions and book clubs because there's a lot to ponder over. 

I do not know how to express the valuable thoughts that this book gifted me. Anyways, Rachel Joyce is indeed a talented writer, one who writes from the heart. Here are some beautiful thoughts in her own words:

_“If we don't go mad once in a while, there's no hope.”_

_“You got up, and you did something. And if trying to find a way when you don't even know you can get there isn't a small miracle; then I don't know what is.”_

_“If we can't accept what we don't know, there really is no hope.”_

_“You could be ordinary and attempt something extraordinary, without being able to explain it in a logical way.”_

_“The least planned part of the journey, however, was the journey itself.”_

_“If I just keep putting one foot in front of the other, it stands to reason that I'm going to get there.”_

_“The past was the past; there was no escaping your beginnings.”_

_“The people he met, the places he passed, were all steps in his journey, and he kept a place inside his heart for each of them.”_
