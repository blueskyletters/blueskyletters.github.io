_A highly thought-provoking and charming book_

Before I go into the review, let me tell you how I discovered this book. I was mesmerized by the book _A Man Called Ove_ by Frederik Backman. Who wouldn't? The realistically heart-warming story that makes one cry and laugh at the same time. So I wanted to find a book that had such a simple yet powerfully beautiful story. Google gave me a couple of recommendations and _The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry_ was one of them. If you loved Ove, then I would definitely recommend you to take a walk with Harold. 

Synopsis:  One fine morning, a retired old man Harold Fry sets out to post a letter to his old colleague and friend, Queenie. But he spontaneously decides to head-off in her far away direction. And so Mr. Fry begins his pilgrimage from one end of the country to the other, to save his friend's life.

What I loved the most about this book is its simplicity; the hero is not a rich and good-looking guy...he's just a person with flaws like you and me; the plot isn't complicated and the author doesn't give you a hard time with unbreakable words. It's an unembellished story of an ordinary man who embarks on the journey of a lifetime.
