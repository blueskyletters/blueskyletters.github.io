_A highly thought-provoking and charming book_

One fine morning, a retired old man Harold Fry sets out to post a letter to his old colleague and friend, Queenie. But he spontaneously decides to head-off in her far away direction. And so Mr. Fry begins his pilgrimage from one of the country to the other in order to save his friend's life.
