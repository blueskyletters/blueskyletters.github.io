_A highly thought-provoking and charming book_

Before I go into the review, let me tell you how I discovered this book. I was mesmerized by the book _A Man Called Ove_ by Frederik Backman. Who wouldn't? A realistically heart-warming story that makes one cry and laugh at the same time. So I wanted to find a book that had such a simple yet powerfully beautiful story. Google gave me a couple of recommendations and _The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry_ was one of them. If you loved Ove, then I would definitely recommend you to take a walk with Harold. 

I loved the purity and spare beauty of this sad but uplifting tale. At first I wondered how I could possibly get involved in this apparently absurd story.  But it was a quick read and full of pleasant surprises and many special moments. One fine morning, a retired old man Harold Fry sets out to post a letter to his old colleague and friend, Queenie, who suffers from a grave illness. But he spontaneously decides to head-off in her far away direction. And so Mr. Fry ends up setting out on a 500 mile walk to visit her. 

What I loved the most about this book is its simplicity; the hero is not a rich and good-looking guy...he's just a person with flaws like you and me; the plot isn't complicated and the author doesn't give you a hard time with unbreakable words. It's an unembellished story of an ordinary man who embarks on the journey of a lifetime. It's an introspective story and deals with a lot of issues quietly. At times, it felt like I was reading a non-fiction book with lots of valuable insights. Such was its power- one of the few books that I felt has a great touch with reality and the bitter-sweet nature of life in general. It will strike a chord with many many people. This is the kind of book that would be best for discussions and book clubs because there's a lot to ponder over.
