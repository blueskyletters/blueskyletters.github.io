A psychological suspense novel, that keeps our every emotion high...

Reading this book has been a special journey for me, during which I had a lot of thoughts. It's the kind of book that you get every once in a while which puts you in a hangover. A little out of my comfort zone, but I'm really glad that I came across this book.

Zara is a very confined young woman who is haunted by her past. One day, she receives a strange mail from "the Storyteller". From there, we are taken through a series of events in her life. This book explores various sensitive issues such as PTSD, childhood trauma, and abuse. An enigmatic tale intertwined with love, grief, and betrayal, _The Storyteller_ will grip you till the very last page. 

Zara is a character that intrigued me and will remain one of my favorite fictional characters. Zara's mind, her fears, her scars, her nightmares, her desires, her quest for solace....all became my concern too.

Have you ever wondered how the life of a person with PTSD might be? How do their minds work? What are their thoughts? The Storyteller vividly presents this, and that's something I loved about this book.
