Reading this book has been a special journey for me, during which I had a lot of thoughts. It's the kind of book that you get every once in a while which puts you in a hangover. A little out of my comfort zone, but I'm really glad that I came across this book.

Zara is a very confined young woman who is haunted by her past. One day, she receives a strange mail from "the Storyteller". From there, we are taken through a series of events in her life. This book explores various sensitive issues such as PTSD, childhood trauma, and abuse. An enigmatic tale intertwined with love, grief and betrayal, _The Storyteller_ will grip you till the very last page.
