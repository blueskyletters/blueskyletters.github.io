Though  I've turned the pages of many books, I've never rendered a particular character as a favourite. But recently a book just made me fall in love with the most lovable fictional character- Anne of Green Gables.

A children's novel written by Lucy Montgomery in 1908, this book is all one needs for a light reading with a sensible story. I'll try to give a small character sketch about Anne without any spoilers to the story.

Anne is a role model for young girls and a nostalgia-bringer for older readers. That's what makes the novel more than just a children's novel. Every person who had a wonderful childhood close with nature with cheerful friends and abundant imagination finds Anne relatable. Within a few pages of the novel, in Anne's own word, Anne becomes our _"kindred spirit"_.

Anne is an inspiration. She brings out the importance of thoughts in life. Anne tries to find beauty and happiness in everything around her. She is an ever faithful friend who can love with all her heart. But Anne can also hold a grudge to whom she dislikes, just as she did to Gilbert.

Though Anne has vanity at first (which reaches its peak when she accidentally dies her hair green), she then realizes that beauty of character is much more important than anything else. This makes Anne more than just a heroine. The author was so sensible in portraying Anne as such during a time when external appearance of ladies mattered than anything else.

Anne of Green Gables is a
