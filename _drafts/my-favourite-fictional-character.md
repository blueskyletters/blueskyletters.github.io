Though  I've turned the pages of many books, I've never rendered a particular character as a favourite. But recently a book just made me fall in love with the most lovable fictional character- Anne of Green Gables.

A children's novel written by Lucy Montgomery in 1908, this book is all one needs for a light reading with a sensible story. I'll try to give a small character sketch about Anne without any spoilers to the story.

Anne of Green Gables is a character far from perfect. She is imperfectly adorable with her cleverness and lively attitude. This novel is written in the early 20th century. But Anne is so unlike the common girl in her times in every aspect. She is brave enough to speak her thoughts. Anne does not fall into the common fancies that every girl thinks more important like boys and beauty. Though Anne has vanity at first, she then realizes that beauty of character is much more important than anything else. This is what makees her stand out among her peers and Anne becomes loved by all in Avonlea.

Anne is a role model for young girls and a nostalgia-bringer for older readers. That's what makes the novel more than just a children's novel. Every person who hada wonderful childhood in the countryside with cheerful friends and abundant imagination findsAnne relatable. Within a few pages of the novel, in Anne's own word, you become "kindred spirits"with Anne.
