_It is rare for someone who wants power to truly deserve it_

Book: Thorn | Author: Intisar Khanani | Genre: Fantasy | Pages: 500 |

My Rating: 5/5

For all the fantasy lovers: this book is a must-read. As for those of you who aren't much into fantasy, like me, this book may change your views on this genre.

I must say, that as a debut author, Khanani has done a good job!

_Thorn_ is the re-telling of a Grimm's fairytale named _Goosegirl._ It doesn't matter if you have or haven't read it before. The story is brilliantly told and the characters are very well developed. The fantasy elements are skillfully intertwined with the story, making it believable. 

I am very thankful that I came across this book. It introduced me to a character that I will always remember. 

Thorn, our princess and goosegirl, can be related to the typical teenage girl who is socially-awkward, struggling with identity crisis and self-doubt. She is kind and understanding, values friendship over luxuries. Her character is so genuine that we feel instant love for her.
