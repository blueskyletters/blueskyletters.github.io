_It is rare for someone who wants power to truly deserve it_

Book: Thorn | Author: Intisar Khanani | Genre: Fantasy, Coming-of-Age | Pages: 500 |

My Rating: 5/5

For all the fantasy lovers: this book is a must-read. As for those of you who aren't much into fantasy, like me, this book may change your views on this genre.

_Thorn_ is the re-telling of a Grimm's fairytale named _Goosegirl._ It doesn't matter if you have or haven't read it before. The story is brilliantly told and the characters are very well developed. The fantasy elements are skillfully intertwined with the story, making it believable.

I am very thankful that I came across this book. It introduced me to a character that I will always remember.

Thorn or Alyrra, our princess and goosegirl, can be related to the typical teenage girl who is socially-awkward, struggling with identity crisis and self-doubt. She is kind and understanding, values friendship over luxuries. Her character seems so realistic that we feel instant love for her. Though she is deeply betrayed by her family and peers, she shows courage and avoids other's sympathy. Her silence is her strength. But, over time, she evolves into a girl with a purpose and aim, holding strong to her values.

Alyrra isn't one of those over-optimistic characters. She is, in every way, genuine. She trembles in fear when she faces danger, she cries when hurt, she is as confused as a puzzle.... But her young heart won't give up. Each event that crushes her only builds up her courage, her will to do the right thing. Instead of falling into the fallacies of the world, Alyrra opens her eyes to a new world, toiling her way to happiness.

I would like to consider _Thorn_ a novel in the coming-of-age genre, more than just a fantasy novel. It's the story of the gradual maturity of Princess Alyrra, her various adventures and the making of crucial life choices. We have much to learn from her: bravery, patience, friendship, love, silence...

After finishing the 500-page book, I still felt that I hadn't gotten enough of Alyrra's story. I felt that the end is just the beginning... a new dawn on her life. I want to know about all the things she does as a princess, all the good changes that she'll bring when she rules, the growing bond with Kestrin... 

If you've read this far, you probably got how much I loved this book. It will be the one I cherish always and recommend to many.

I must say, that as a debut author, Khanani has done a fantastic job! Looking forward to more of her books.
