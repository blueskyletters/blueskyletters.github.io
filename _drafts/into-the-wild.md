> _"Happiness is only real when shared"_

It's not everyday you watch a movie that touches your heart and charms you for a while. The 2007 movie Into The Wild, directed by Sean Penn is one such movie. Thtais why I thought to write a small review on this movie. ( Warning: Spoilers Ahead!)

This movie is an adaptation of a book of the same name written by Jon Krakauer. Adventure and travel can be given as the categories of this movie.an interesting fact is that the movie was actually inspired by a true story. THis movie can be regarded as a masterpiece. It has originality in it's presentation and a perfect storyline. Though it has a tragic ending, the movie captures the audince attention right till the end. The character Christopher McCandless, later renaming himself as  Alexander Supertramp quickly earns our hearts. 

A story of a young man who emarks on a journey into the wild, giving up all his material posessions, family and even his identity. It truly is a beautiful adventure that he embarks on. On his way, Chris performs adventurousthings that others warn him not to. He hikes across North America and reaches the Alaskan wilderness, his dream destination. He find s an abandoned bus and calls it "The Magic Bus". Chris happily lives in the wild, hunting for food and recording all his events in a journal. He divides it into chapters. 

What struck me most in this movie other than the horo's determination is the beautiful quotes that are often spoken. They are presented in the most apt situations. The movie contins many such inspiring words:

_"The core of man's spirit comes from experiences."_

_"Rather than love, than faith, than fairness, give me the truth"_

_“It's not always necessary to be strong, but to feel strong.” ..._

_"When you forgive, you love. And when you love, God’s light shines upon you.”_

But the best of all is:  
_"Happiness is only real when shared"_, which is what he learns eventually living in the loneliness of his magic bus.

The movie, apart from being an inspiration for hippies and adventures, also teaches you the valuable lesson-be satisfied with what you have. It brings the out the horrors of loneliness of the human soul, despite it getting the adventure it wanted.

Some may find this movie a little monotonous and overrated. It definitely is not a fast paced movie. One should enjoy it with an adventurous perspective.

A must-watch movie. In three words , it can be described as beautiful, deep and adventurous.
