Nowadays, mental health hashtags have been trending. People are finally beginning to realize its importance and care to address the issue.  There are a lot of stigmas associated with this and it is starting to change. It's not a surprise, that in this fast-paced age, mental health is among the leading causes of illness. If you haven't yet grasped the significance of this topic, it's high time you know about it.

What is depression? Is it the same as sadness or gloom? The answer is no. Sadness is caused by an external situation while depression may be caused by the fluctuation of hormones, genetic causes, or others. Sometimes, the person may not even know the cause of it. It's a feeling of emptiness, no longer being able to enjoy your favorite things, increasing feelings of hopelessness, loss of appetite and sleep...Anyway, the cause and symptoms of mental health disorders are something we should know about from professionals.

Let's talk statistics. According to WHO, one in four people in the world will be affected by mental disorders at some point in their lives. This probability is higher for women; which means that one in every five women we know in our lives may be suffering from depression or other disorders. It is surprising to know that such illness is very common among a population (more than ten million cases per year in India). Yet, the stigma around mental health is still large.

If you feel that someone around you is showing symptoms of depression, do try to help them out and if someone is bold enough to speak up on their mental illness, do give them an ear, instead of neglecting it as a mere mood swing or petty issue. People who suffer from such illnesses

 face the problem of a lack of support from their surroundings.
