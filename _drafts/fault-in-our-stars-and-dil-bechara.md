_“As he read, I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once.”_

I read this book long ago. I remembered it now after watching the movie _Dil Bechara,_ the Hindi adaptation of Fault in Our Stars. As for the book, I can say that John Green succeeded in bringing out a very meaningful and heart-touching young adult novel. Hazel and Augustus will forever remain in our hearts till infinity.
