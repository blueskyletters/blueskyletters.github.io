Mythology has always been one of my favourite genres. Stories that narrate in the perspective of the women in Mythology are the best. The Palace of Illusions is one such beautiful story.

Draupadi, the most famous woman in Mahabharata is the central character of this novel. We see a new perspective of the epic through her eyes. The daughter of fire and her story is very skillfully told with all the right words and all the apt emotions. 

What interested me the most is the inclusion of Karna in the story. Karna is my favourite character from the Mahabharata. He is mentioned in the story in detail.
