Among the many topics write about under the sky that I could, I choose  to write about a story that I have listened to in my chidhood and probably every other child in Kerala.

Some stories, no matter how old they get, ar carried from one generation to the other as they are golden stories that cannot be replaced by any other. Such is the story of a Mannankatta(lump of earth) and Kariyila(dry leaf) which is a very short story with many connotations.

Mannankatta and Kariyila were best friends. They decided to go on a journey to Kasi. It was a jolly journey until a strong wind started to blow. Kariyila, being so light, was about to fly away. But Mannankatta came to his rescue by sitting on top of him. They continued the journey. Later, it started to rain and Mannankatta would have melted away into the earth if it wasn't for Kariyila who shielded him from the downpour. Both of them happily continued, withh the confidence that they were safe as long as they were togrther. The tragedy occured when a huge storm came and yhe fierce wind blew away Kariyila and the rain melted Mannankatta away. Thus both friends were eventually parted.

This story brings tears to the eyes of young kids. Though these two are inanimate characters, we feel sorry for them on how they got separated and never reached their destination.

After many years, thinking of this story in a new perspective brought new meanings to the story.
