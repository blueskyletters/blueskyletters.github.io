> Some stories are Golden and Bring the sweet nostalgia of cjildhood along with it

Among the many topics write about under the sky that I could, I choose  to write about a story that I have listened to in my chidhood and probably every other child in Kerala.

Some stories, no matter how old they get, ar carried from one generation to the other as they are golden stories that cannot be replaced by any other. Such is the story of a Mannankatta(lump of earth) and Kariyila(dry leaf) which is a very short story with many connotations.

Mannankatta and Kariyila were best friends. They decided to go on a journey to Kasi. It was a jolly journey until a strong wind started to blow. Kariyila, being so light, was about to fly away. But Mannankatta came to his rescue by sitting on top of him. They continued the journey. Later, it started to rain and Mannankatta would have melted away into the earth if it wasn't for Kariyila who shielded him from the downpour. Both of them happily continued, withh the confidence that they were safe as long as they were togrther. The tragedy occured when a huge storm came and the fierce wind blew away Kariyila and the rain melted Mannankatta away. Thus both friends were eventually parted.

The story of an immortal friendship as the Mannakatta remains in the earth and the Kariyila still flies with the wind.

This story brings tears to the eyes of young kids. Though these two are inanimate characters, we feel sorry for them on how they got separated and never reached their destination.

After many years, thinking of this story in a new perspective brought new meanings to the story. It is a story of **friendship and bravery**. It is a story about **life and its unexpected circumstances**. It teaches us how fragile we are despite the ablities we have. It tells us so clearly that **embarking on adventures in life is definitely risky** **and sometimes may end in tragedy**. The story picturises how **the most unlikely pair can become friends**. 

We may feel that the story is abit discoraging and tragic to be told to young kids but it is true. The story of Mannankatta and Kariyila so vividly expresse the bitter truth of life in a simple way to young minds. It brings out the universal truth that **nothing can last forever** and **one day we shall all too be a memory; our body shall melt away into the earth as Manankatta and our soul fly away to the hereafter like Kariyila and we may leave some uncherished dreams behind.**

It is strange how such a short nursery story imbibes in it the deep meanings and truths of life. Every child should be told the story of Mannankatta and Kariyila.

As I brood over the fact of how much meaning I could think of from this simple story, I hope that maybe my life may also get immortalised in a story that atleast some may remember.
