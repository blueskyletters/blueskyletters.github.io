_A contemporary young adult fiction, narrating a unique friendship story_

_Author: Arjun Nath |  My rating; 3/5_

First of all, let's take a moment to appreciate the cover page design. It's my favorite one yet! 

_Not All Those Who Wander_ is a tale of millennial friendship.  The plot is unique and out of the ordinary, which is why I liked it. It doesn't have any cliched touches. Millennials who live an urban life can definitely relate to this book. Eram and Gehna, the central characters, are two teenagers from different social backgrounds, living in the same city- Mumbai. Their common miseries unite them as best friends. Both of them share a bond, which they later understand as very complicated.

Coming to the writing style; it's simple and elegant with a touch of adolescent slangs. Although it has the young-adult style language, it doesn't get corny like many other books of the same genre. In fact, the vocabulary used is good and I got a few new words from the book. The plot develops smoothly but in the middle, I felt that it's too slow. We get to realize most of the intensity of the relationship between the two characters only in the last part of the book, that too in very few pages. I think that the characters and incidents should have been a little more developed. Most of what's written in the book are about the inner thoughts of the characters, which is very skillfully expressed. Some of the details of the story got a bit confusing. nevertheless, Not All Those Who Wander has an overall charm and is one of the best Young Adult fiction I've read so far.
