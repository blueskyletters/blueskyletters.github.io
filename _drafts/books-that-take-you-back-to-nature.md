“That’s the thing about books. They let you travel without moving your feet” – Jhumpa Lahiri (The Namesake)

I love reading books that emphasised on the little joys around us; those are the ones that still stay with me. There are many writers who have captured the essence of nature in pages. Such books are one of the most treasured ones that I possess. When we feel the need to escape the mundaneness of city life or the monotony of routine, reading such books is definitely refreshing. 

Here are 5 books I would suggest that has the richness of natural beauty in its pages:

#### Anne of Green Gables by L. M. Montgomery

This is one of my favourite novels. We are taken to the scenic village of Avonlea, through the life of a gingery-girl, [Anne](https://blueskyletters.com/my-favourite-fictional-character/ "Character sketch of Anne of Green Gables"). She is one of my favourite fictional characters and one that we may relate to- Anne’s love for nature and books, her stubbornness... Anne's lush green place with ‘beautiful Octobers’ is worth a visit.

#### The Secret Garden by Francis Hudson Burnette

_The Secret Garden_ is one of those ever-green books that will be read by generations to come. Though it’s a children’s novel, it can be enjoyed by readers of all ages. The story and setting of this 1911 book, is mesmerizing, just like the title. The setting of the story is a mansion situated at the beautiful moors of London. 

#### Books by Ruskin Bond

The famous nature writer from India, almost all of Ruskin Bond’s works centres around nature. He published his first book when he was just 17. The stories are very simple, touching our hearts with the humble storylines. _The Blue Umbrella_ and _The Room On the Roof_ are two of his books that I really loved. Bond derives inspiration from his childhood life in Dehradun and weaves it into stories.  His stories are always admirable, with its innocent characters and meaningful plots. 

#### Where the Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens

_Where the Crawdads Sing_ is at once an exquisite ode to the natural world, a heartbreaking coming-of-age story, and a surprising tale of murder. Owens reminds us that we are forever shaped by the children we once were and that we are all subject to the beautiful and violent secrets that nature keeps. The protagonist is an intriguing girl called “Marsh Girl” who is sensitive, intelligent, and wildly beautiful.

#### The Wind in the Willows by Kenneth Grahame

A much-loved children’s book, The Wind in the Willows is another adventurous book you’d love. It’s an easy read with a beautiful storyline. One would fall in love with the characters along with the story. The characters are small animals, who escape to find adventure.
