_A beautiful nineteenth-century classic, beautiful and perfect..._

And so, I have finally read Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen's most popular work. Two thoughts were in my mind before I started this book: That I am about to read a Classic that is cherished by many readers worldwide and second that I'm about to read a work by history's earliest accomplished female author. Hence, I started this reading journey with a lot of high hopes and expectations. And, I must say that this book was a wonderful experience.
