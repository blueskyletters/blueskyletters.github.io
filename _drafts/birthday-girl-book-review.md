A short story with an aura of mysticism...

_Birthday Girl_ by Murakami is the first book I picked up of this author. I've seen mixed opinions on Murakami's works and I thought I'd start the journey to Murakami's magical realistic world with a short read. 

Just as I expected, this book was a new experience. Most short stories give more importance to the plots and I wrongly thought thas this one was the same. _Birthday Girl_ has a philosophical touch, the feel of which lingers with us long after we finish reading it. Everyone who has read Murakami knows that it's not the ending that matters; rather the journey, the thoughts we have, the style, etc.

Never have I read a piece of writing so strange yet so peculiarly satisfying. In a very narrow perspective, this story may seem a very disappointing read- with no closure and poor character formation.
