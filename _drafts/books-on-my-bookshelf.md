I feel content in buying books and feel pride in looking at them on the shelf though there are some who advice me to buy a "Kindle or something instead of wasting money on books". Well, they don't really know the pleasure of owning books, do they? Books are indeed the best gifts, best treasures and are irreplacable by anything else.

Today, I took a look at my little book collection and thought, why not do a blog post on it". Thogh there are just a handful of books on my shelf, they were quite a good collection. I'll introduce you to 6 of the books among them from different genres.

#### A Beautiful Novel

[_The Kite Runner - Khaled Hosseini_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77203.The_Kite_Runner "The Kite Runner-goodreads")

This picturesque novel is the best I've read so far. A coming-of-age story set in pre-war Afghanisthan, narrates the life of a young boy Amir and his closest friend Hassan. It is a tale of courage, friendship, redemption, devotion and atonement.

#### A Self-help Book

[_Who Moved My Cheese? - Dr. Spenser Johnson_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4894.Who_Moved_My_Cheese_ "Who moved my cheese?")

A book which can be finished in less than an hour, has some valuable insights that can be useful throughout your life time. It has thought provoking concepts on life, career and relationships.

#### An Emotional Book

[The Shack - WM Paul Young](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40874325-the-shack "The shack")

The story revolves around the abductiona nd death of the protagonist's youngest daughter. This book enlivened with spirituality and mystery has powerful writing that brings tears to the eyes of the reader.
