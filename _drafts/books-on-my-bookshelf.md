I feel content in buying books and feel pride in looking at them on the shelf though there are some who advice me to buy a "Kindle or something instead of wasting money on books". Well, they don't really know the pleasure of owning books, do they? Books are indeed the best gifts, best treasures and are irreplacable by anything else. 

Today, I took a look at my little book collection and thought, why not do a blog post on it". Thogh there are just a handful of books on my shelf, they were quite a good collection. I'll introduce you to 6 of the books among them from different genres.

#### A Beautiful Novel

[_The Kite Runner - Khaled Hosseini_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77203.The_Kite_Runner "The Kite Runner-goodreads")

This picturesque novel is the best I've read so far. A coming-of-age story set in pre-war Afghanisthan, narrates the life of a young boy Amir and his closest friend Hassan. It is a tale of courage, friendship, redemption, devotion and atonement.

#### A Self-help Book

_Who Moved My Cheese? - Dr. Spenser Johnson_
