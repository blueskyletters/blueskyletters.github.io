I feel content in buying books and feel pride in looking at them on the shelf though there are some who advice me to buy a "Kindle or something instead of wasting money on books". Well, they don't really know the pleasure of owning books, do they? Books are indeed the best gifts, best treasures and are irreplaceable by anything else.

Today, I took a look at my little book collection and thought, why not do a blog post on it". Though there are just a handful of books on my shelf, they were quite a good collection. I'll introduce you to 6 of the books among them from different genres.

#### A Beautiful Novel

[_The Kite Runner - Khaled Hosseini_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77203.The_Kite_Runner "The Kite Runner-goodreads")

This picturesque novel is the best I've read so far. A coming-of-age story set in pre-war Afghanisthan narrates the life of a young boy Amir and his closest friend Hassan. It is a tale of courage, friendship, redemption, devotion and atonement.

#### A Self-help Book

[_Who Moved My Cheese? - Dr Spenser Johnson_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4894.Who_Moved_My_Cheese_ "Who moved my cheese?")

A book which can be finished in less than an hour has some valuable insights that can be useful throughout your lifetime. It has thought-provoking concepts on life, career and relationships.

#### An Emotional Book

[_The Shack - WM Paul Young_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40874325-the-shack "The shack")

The story revolves around the abduction and murder of the protagonist's youngest daughter. This book enlivened with spirituality and mystery has powerful writing that brings tears to the eyes of the reader.

#### A Book with Illustrations

[_Diary of a Wimpy Kid: the ugly truth - Jeff Kinney_]()

This international best-seller is filled with simple drawings from the daily life of a teen Greg Heffley. A hilarious children's book in the form of a diary, Wimpy Kid can be amusing even to adults.

#### An Autobiography

[_The Story of my Life - Hellen Keller_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/821611.The_Story_of_My_Life "The Story of my Life")

The story of such a brave and heroic personality is ever-inspiring. Keller describes her childhood, struggles and learning processes with great detail and interest.

#### A Malayalam Book

[Ntuppuppakkoranendarnnu! - Vaikom Muhammed Basheer](https://www.goodreads.com/fr/book/show/35223097-ntuppuppakkoranendarnnu "Ntuppuppakkoranendarnnu!")

Non-Malayalees, don't fret. The title simply translates as 'my grandfather had an elephant'. I thought the list would be incomplete without adding a book from my mother tongue. This novella The story is filled with pleasant humour and anecdotes from Muslim religious lore. The title refers to people boasting of the past glories, their "grandfather's elephant", to hide their present shortcomings. it is written in a humorous style and the characters attain a place in the reader's heart.
