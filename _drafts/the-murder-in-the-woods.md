An enticing and anticipating short read

The Murder in the Woods by Shruti Priyaa is the second book in the Sinners and Secrets series. Here's the blurb:

_The skeletal remains of a body are found under a barren tree deep inside the woods. Detective Raunak Sharma is put in charge of the case. The forensic reveals that the skeleton is at least two years old! Raunak begins digging up old cases and Samaira, the nosy reporter, runs away with the skeleton, trying to find the killer on her own! Will she beat Raunak in finding the killer this time? Most of all, who is the killer?_

I liked this story even better than the previous one in the series. The plot is unique and all the details are well researched. We can see that the writer has put in much effort even though it is a short story. The book started giving me the creeps right from the beginning! It starts with a description of Aarey Forest, the place where the body was found. It's a very eerie place with a peculiar darkness. The scene was so aptly described that it resembled a Gothic theme. I really loved this.

In 33 pages, the book was enticing and suspenseful. I would say that it's a capsule of suspense and mystery. 

This story ends in a cliffhanger. I'm definitely looking forward to Raunak's and Samaira's next adventures.

I would recommend this book to those who love suspense and crime. Also, try picking this up if you are going through a reading slump.
