Have you ever found yourself stuck and unable to turn the pages of a book? Sometimes, do you feel bored while reading and fail to concentrate? Well, that's when you are in a reading slump! Don't worry, it's absolutely normal. It's just a phase and there are some easy ways to get out of a reading slump. Here are some from my experience.

* **Pick up Small-sized Books**

Reading large books is the last thing you wanna do in a reading slump. If you do so, you are likely to leave it in the DNF(Do Not Finish) category and fall into an even deeper reading slump. Pick up books that are less than 200 pages and try reading them slowly. When you finish them, it will give you a sense of accomplishment which will motivate you to read more books and probably get out of the slump. 

* **Read Rom-coms or Children's Classics**

  This is a tried and tested method. Romantic and young adult novels are written in simple styles and have appealing plots. Reading such books are less likely to make you bored. Reading a children's classic is also effective. The childish and innocent stories may refresh your minds and encourage you to read more.
* **Re-read a Favourite**
