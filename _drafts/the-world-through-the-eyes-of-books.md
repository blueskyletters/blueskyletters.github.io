We know that the world is large. All the 7.8 billion people scattered across the seven continents have diverse cultures, languages and ethics. It makes us wonder how different and unique the mankind is. This awe is usually what drives travelers to wander across the world, curious to explore the different landscapes and human culture.

I'm a person who loves to travel a lot. But, at the same time, I'm also the kind who loves to enjoy the rain alone reading a book in a comfy corner. But if you look at it in another way, I think both of these are the same thing. We travel, taking our physical self into an unknown place: we read taking our mind into an unknown world. What's even more exciting is that books can transport us to another time, even the future! That's my favorite part of reading-being able to explore places, people, culture and time by sitting in a corner of your room :)

I always try to collect books from different countries. Reading them leaves me pondering on the place, dreaming of the landscapes and wondering about their unique traditions. The Spanish pastures from _The Alchemist_, the village of Umuofia from _Things Fall Apart_, Malgudi from R.K. Narayan's works, Afghanistan from _The Kite Runner,_ 20th century America from _The Great Gatsby....._ The list goes on and on. As for the different cultures, I could write endlessly...
