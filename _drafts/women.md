> She is water. Powerful enough to drown you, soft enough to cleanse you, deep enough to save you.

Dedicated to all the amazing women in my life.

Women are the epitome of sacrifice. Think about it. it's like the sole purpose of her living is for the goodwill of those she loves. I refuse to believe that women are weak. In fact, they are stronger, braver and wiser. She is a marvellous creation. She makes a house a home, produces life, spreads love... It's sad to know that there are communities in the world that loathes the birth of a girl child!

She has fought a thousand battles in her life .....

And still standing. Has cried a thousand tears.....and still smiling. Has been broken, rejected....but still walks proudly.....laughs loud, lives without fear, loves without boundaries... Humble and Beautiful.
