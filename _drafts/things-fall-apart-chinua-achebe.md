_A historical fiction_

AS the names suggests, the novel has a tragic ending. What's unique about this book is that the author clearly paints a picture of the African culture of the savages in Niger in simple language. He is successful in giving the readers an insight into the lives of the villagers in Umuofia by narrating the story of Okonkwo.

Okonkwo is a young and ambitious man who sought success and fame in his life. The ups and downs in his life, the Igbo culture and traditions is the essence of the book.
