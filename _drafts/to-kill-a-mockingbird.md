Another book with memorable characters and events.

A very popular modern classic by Harper Lee, To Kill A Mockingbird narrates a coming-of-age story with interesting detail. The themes includes racist Southern culture which is deeply rooted in violence and prejudice. As many of us know, the message of this 1960 novel is relevant even in the present society. A novel with a socially relevant theme and a beautiful story line which includes a rural touch is such a perfect combination.

The most interesting aspect of this novel is that the whole story is narrated by an child. An eight year old child's perspective of the story does not diminish the meaningful themes of the novel in any way. The twists and turns in the lives of siblings Scout and Jem, their upbringing, typical childhood days etc, are all so interesting. The racial discrimination of the people is intertwined with their lives through a case taken up by their father Atticus Finch, who is a lawyer. This influences their lives.

What I liked the most in the novel is undoubtedly the childhood adventures and experience of Scout and Jem. Scout is a girl who quickly became my favorite character. The children's curiosity about their neighbor Boo Radley and the subsequent incidents is specifically
