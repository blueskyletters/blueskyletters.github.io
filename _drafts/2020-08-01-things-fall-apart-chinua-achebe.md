_A Historical Fiction by Chinua Achebe_

As the names suggests, the novel has a tragic ending. What's unique about this book is that the author clearly paints a picture of the African culture of the savages in Niger in simple language. He is successful in giving the readers an insight into the lives of the villagers in Umuofia by narrating the story of Okonkwo.

Okonkwo is a young and ambitious man who sought success and fame in his life. The ups and downs in his life, the Igbo culture and traditions is the essence of the book.The author presents a true picture of what village life was like before contact with Europeans. Every aspect of Okonkwo's life is interesting and sometimes surprising. The marriage ceremonies, harvest festivals, human sacrifices etc grips the reader.

What I liked the most is obviously being able to know about a different culture and its traditions. It makes us have a wider perspective of people and culture. It surprises us how different the people of the world are. Okonkwo and his notions seem strange to us.

We learn that the Igbo people's staple food is cassava and palm oil, their wedding gifts include gallons of wines, human sacrifices are done once in a while, locusts are also a preferable food item, they worship nature and many other facts.

The concept of masculinity and strength is very down rated. For example, Okonkwo describes very act of weakness and cowardice as "womanly". When his son fails to be as active as himself, he calls him a woman. He doesn't even accept that women are skilled even when he understands that his daughter Ezinma is more talented. Okonkwo frequently says, "I wish Ezinma were a girl". It seems to suggest that he secretly desires affectionate attachment with his actual sons, but avoids admitting it as he thinks that affectionate is equal to weakness. It is interesting to note that Okonkwo doesnâ€™t wish that Ezinma were a boy because she exhibits desirable masculine traits; rather, it is their bond of sympathy and understanding that he values. Although women are not much valued in the village, their most holy priest is  a woman, Ekinza. Her prophecies and advices are highly valued by the men.

In total, the novel is an interesting read, though sometimes I felt that it got a little monotonous.

Goodreads rating: 3.7/5                     My Rating: 4/5

## Summary (with spoilers)
