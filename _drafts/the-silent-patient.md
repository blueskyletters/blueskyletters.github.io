You might wonder: what's the thrill in a murder story if you already know the killer? Well, _The Silent Patient_ is beyond just a murder mystery- it reveals the mysteries of the psyche, the strings of thoughts that lead to their actions, why notoriety is born in a mind, how true love transformed into murderous hate. The question till the plot twist is not 'who', it's **_'why'_**. Each page keeps us thinking and guessing the reason behind the cruel act. Initially, the narrator assures us that he knows all the answers and will reveal it gradually. From there, it's a heart-racing reading journey.
