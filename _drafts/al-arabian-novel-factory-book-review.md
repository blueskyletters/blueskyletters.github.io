A very interesting Historical fiction, focusing on the Jasmine Revolution of the Gulf Peninsula.

Book: Al Arabian Novel Factory | Author: Benyamin | pages: 376 | language: Malayalam( English translation available)

Al Arabian Novel Factory by Benyamin is the twin novel of Jasmine Days, the JCB Award Winning book. 

Anyone who read Benyamin's _Aadujeevitham_(Goat Days) would be familiar with his heart-touching characters and intense emotions he portrays through his lucid writing. There is a certain simplicity that captured me, making readers admire his writing skills.
