A very interesting Historical fiction, focusing on the Jasmine Revolution of the Gulf Peninsula.

Book: Al Arabian Novel Factory | Author: Benyamin | pages: 376 | language: Malayalam( English translation available)

Al Arabian Novel Factory by Benyamin is the twin novel of Jasmine Days, the JCB Award Winning book of the same author. Prathap, a journalist, arrives in an Arabian city for a strange novel project along with three of his colleagues. Although the city is unnamed in this book, it is described as a place between Saudi Arabia and Iran. This book is a collection of different experiences of different kinds of people from this tumultuous Arab city through the point-of-view of Prathap.

Though the book is quite lengthy and includes many historical and geographical references, I never felt bored; because it was narrated skillfully, with a strong yet lucid style of writing. The characters in it were unique, very realistic, and kept me wondering more about them.  The book attempts to portray the events during and after the Jasmine revolution. We can see that the book is well-researched for

Anyone who read Benyamin's _Aadujeevitham_(Goat Days) would be familiar with his heart-touching characters and intense emotions that he portrays through his lucid writing style. There is a certain simplicity that captured me. He brings out the bitterness and harsh realities very frankly.
