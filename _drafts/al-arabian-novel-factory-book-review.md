A very interesting Historical fiction, focusing on the Jasmine Revolution of the Gulf Peninsula.

Book: Al Arabian Novel Factory | Author: Benyamin | pages: 376 | language: Malayalam( English translation available)

Al Arabian Novel Factory by Benyamin is the twin novel of Jasmine Days, the JCB Award Winning book of the same author. Prathap, a journalist, arrives in an Arabian city for a strange novel project along with three of his colleagues. Although the city is unnamed in this book, it is described as a place between Saudi Arabia and Iran. This book is a collection of different experiences of different kinds of people from this tumultuous Arab city through the point-of-view of Prathap, focusing on the events of the Jasmine revolution.

Though the book is quite lengthy and includes many historical and geographical references, I never felt bored; because it was narrated skillfully, with a strong yet lucid style of writing. And Prathap's search for Jasmine, his lost lover, added to the anticipation, making it a real page-turner. The characters in it were unique, very realistic, and kept me wondering more about them. 

There is a banned novel mentioned in this book, which plays a major role in the events of the story and puts the characters through a lot of trouble. This is the twin novel of this book- _Jasmine Days_ 

 _We can se_e that the book is well researched- details gathered from historical events, Islamic texts, and anecdotes of people from the Arab countries.

Anyone who read Benyamin's _Aadujeevitham_(Goat Days) would be familiar with his heart-touching characters and intense emotions that he portrays through his lucid writing style. He brings out the bitterness and harsh realities very frankly. There is a certain simplicity that captured me, yet the seriousness of the theme wasn't lost. That is why I think Benyamin is a writer who writes for everyone. 

If you are interested in historical fiction or want to read about Arab countries, without a biased opinion.
