Do you have any bookish goals apart from the number of books to read in a year and the Goodreads challenge?

Though I have read many books over the years, my reading had been restricted to a few genres. Lately, I had the urge to read books from different genres. Hopefully, this will give a wider perspective and make my reading experience more enjoyable. After experimenting with various genres, I realized that I don't have a favourite category or genre. Also, it nurtures my love for books.
