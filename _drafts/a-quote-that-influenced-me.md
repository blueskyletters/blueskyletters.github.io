An Inspirational quote is a collection of a few strong words born out of wisdom and experience. We aways come across such quotes all the time. But among those random quotes, some are really striking and will influence us. Isn't it amazing how such few words can contain dee meanings? I'm going to write about one such quote that really influenced me.

_"Your Thoughts are a Creartive Power to use to Materialise your Dreams" - Rhonda Byrne_

First, let me introduce you to the owner of this quote-Rhonda Byrne. She is an Australian writer famous for her best-selling self-help book 'The Magic'. I haven't actually read the book because I didn't get my hands on it yet, but it's definitely on my redaing list. I've heard a few motivational speakers mention quotes from this book and I've seen them on social media too.

Every other quote we come across is either about hardwork or success or of the sort. That's where Rhonda Byrne's quote stands out.  This is just one of her many other inspiring words in her million-dollar book.

This quote is about the power of visualization.
