A well-crafted psychological thriller...

I picked up _The Woman in the Window_ by A. J Finn when I craved to read a thriller, because of all the hype surrounding it. Though there are some reviews stating that this is a totally overrated book, I did not regret reading it! _The Woman in the Window_ did good justice to the psychological thriller genre.

Here's a short synopsis:

Anna Fox suffers from agoraphobia, an anxiety disorder, and always stays indoors. She spends her time observing her neighbours through the bedroom window. One day, Anna hears a frenzied scream and witnesses something horrible that she shouldn't have seen. She must do everything to uncover the truth.

The suspense element was maximum in the plot. It kept me guessing till the very end! I won't say that the climax was mind-blowing or ground-breaking, but the book was definitely a page-turner and the twists were unexpected. Some references to thriller movies that Anna watches adds to the chilliness of the story. 

It is a very long narration and slow-paced at the beginning, through the PoV of Anna Fox, which is quite unusual for a thriller. But all the incidents mentioned at the beginning are all points that lead to the climax. When the book ends, we understand why the author was so specific about all the details. So, if you pick this book up, I would advise you to not lose faith and keep on reading.
