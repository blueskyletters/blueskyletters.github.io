A well-crafted psychological thriller...

I picked up _The Woman in the Window_ by A. J Finn when I craved to read a thriller, because of all the hype surrounding it. Though there are some reviews stating that this is a totally overrated book, I found it definitely worth reading! _The Woman in the Window_ did good justice to the psychological thriller genre.
