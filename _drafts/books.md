I'm starting to miss the outdoors. The bookshelf seen in this photo is from a cafe near my college. It has such a beautiful ambiance. Coffee and books is such a perfect combination and this cafe is my favourite place to chill. 

How is your reading going on during lockdown?

For me, the lockdown really restored my reading skills. In fact, the idea of creating a books and art page came during this time. My reading really got accelerated. Last day, I read a 400 page novel within a day.  

The sad thing is Amazon no longer delivers here...which I can't order books and I'm almost out of them :(   I'm starting to think about e-books. 

Which books are in your current reading list? Here are mine
