**The Basis Of Creativity**

Almost for everything we do, there is always a conventional way to do it; that is, the formal way to carry out a task and confront a problem. But, eventhough such methods yields results they have fewer scope for innovation and no chance for creativity. "Thinking out side the box" is basically a technique to find a new or unconventional  way to approach problems and to look at things in a different perspective.

This concept is the basis of creativity. Creativity is the converting of imaginative ideas into reality. This can only be possible when thoughts are not restricted to just a small space. Instead, you should be able to think widely without any boundaries. Limitless imagination and a thirst for new ideas is the key to creativity.

**Why is thinking outside the box so important?**

You may be a conventional person who is comfortable with doing things the old way and it's not bad. But remember that Leaders bring up an idea rather than follow them. To some, this thinking technique may be a synonym for Risk. Avoiding risks may help you to stay away from mistakes but taking them has a much more potential than pushing ourselves into failure. Risks are essential for growth on a personal and business level.

We live in a society where we are programmed to follow the "good old ways". Anything outside the ordinary is considered absurd and face critisisms most of the time.
