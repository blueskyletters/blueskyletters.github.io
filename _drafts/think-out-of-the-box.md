**The Basis Of Creativity**

Almost for everything we do, there is always a conventional way to do it; that is, the formal way to carry out a task and confront a problem. But, eventhough such methods yields results they have fewer scope for innovation and no chance for creativity. "Thinking out side the box" is basically a technique to find a new or unconventional  way to approach problems and to look at things in a different perspective.

This concept is the basis of creativity. Creativity is the act of converting imaginative ideas into reality. This can only be possible when thoughts are not restricted to a small space. Instead, you should be able to think widely without any boundaries.
