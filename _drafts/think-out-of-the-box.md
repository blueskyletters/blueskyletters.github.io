**The Basis Of Creativity**

Almost for everything we do, there is always a conventional way to do it; that is, the formal way to carry out a task and confront a problem. But, eventhough such methods yields results they have fewer scope for innovation and no chance for creativity. "Thinking out side the box" is basically a technique to find a new or unconventional  way to approach problems and to look at things in a different perspective.

This concept is the basis of creativity. Creativity is the act of converting imaginative ideas into reality. This can only be possible when thoughts are not restricted to just a small space. Instead, you should be able to think widely without any boundaries. Limitless imagination and a thirst for new ideas is the key to creativity.
