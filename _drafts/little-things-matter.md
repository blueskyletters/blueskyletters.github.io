It's yet another environment day.

We see the once-in-a-year greenery posts and quotes everywhere, planting saplings and all the other cliches. A day where the environment is the hero. Now, I'm not saying that such a day is worthless. I just think that all the fuss we make on this day is not enough. And we must do what we can to carry this spirit throughout the year.

I decided to do a post on environment day. There is a wide range of topics we can write about how the earth is dying, how the animals are dying, how we are almost dying.....climate change, global warming, green house effect......The list is endless. I thought that probably almost everyone have heard about all these year after year. I wanted to share details that we all could consider without much difficulty in our everyday lives.
