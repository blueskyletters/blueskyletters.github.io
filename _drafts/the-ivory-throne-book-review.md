Royal traditions, palaces, a strong princess, a remarkable history...

If this book could be described in four phrases, then this is it.

Actually, I don't know how to review this book perfectly, for it is a vast ocean of knowledge on History, focusing mainly on the life of a great woman, Sethu Lekshmi Bai, Princess of Travancore. She ruled Travancore as a regent in the 20th century, bringing forth many bold reforms during her small tenure of seven years. Her wonderful personality and story of her life have made her my new favourite woman in History.

The author has done very extensive research on the historical and political aspects of Kerala and India to write this novel. He has given the reference to the facts mentioned in the book in the notes section in about 100 pages! This book has a lot of details on the history of Kerala, though mostly on the royal family of Travancore, and the social conditions of the age, many of which I haven't heard of before.

The matrilineal system was prevalent in the society of Kerala during the old days. This means that females had a very high position in the hierarchy and accession of the family. Not only were the children of female members of the royal family given rights, but women were also given authority to rule and manage land and treasury. Also, there was a particular region called Attingal which was ruled for many generations by a line of warrior princesses. Female heirs were so important in the royal family, that if there was a scarcity of girl children, little girls would be adopted from other families! The facts from this book were so surprising.

Sethu Lakshmi Bayi was an adopted child to the Travancore house, along with her junior cousin Sethu Parvati Bayi. From mere children, they were transformed into princesses overnight. Both of them were raised to become the Senior and Junior Maharanis respectively. Sethu Lekshmi Bayi became Her Highness the Maharajah of Travancore in 1924 and ruled for seven years as a regent. During this short period, she became known as a wise ruler and an ideal leader. She supported the Vaikom Satyagraha which opened up roads and public property to the 'untouchables'. She invested a significant portion in the building of Kochi port. During her tenure, she extensively supported education especially for women and the first women employees emerged. Apart from these, there are many significant reforms that she brought about in the state. Her personality was exquisite and she earned admiration from her subjects.
