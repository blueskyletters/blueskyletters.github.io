Royal traditions, palaces, a strong princess, a remarkable history...

If this book could be described in four phrases, then this is it.

Actually, I don't know how to review this book perfectly, for it is a vast ocean of knowledge on History, focusing mainly on the life of a great woman, Sethu Lekshmi Bai, Princess of Travancore. She ruled Travancore as a regent in the 20th century, bringing forth many bold reforms during her small tenure of seven years. Her wonderful personality and story of her life have made her my new favourite woman in History.
