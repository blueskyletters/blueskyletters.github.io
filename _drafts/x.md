#### What is a bucket list?

A bucket list is basically a list of things that you want to do in your lifetime. It doesn't have to be big goals. It can be simple wishes to fulfil or experiences to have.

#### Why create a bucket list?

As time goes by, we would all be probably get caught in the rush of our daily lives. We will not have time to think about our other goals. Our professional life may take up all our valuable time. Before you realize it, it would become too late to achieve anything as all our energy, health and money may be drained out. So, making a list of things to do will certainly make a difference.

#### Create your bucket list

Spend some time to think. Brainstorm on what your greatest wishes are What did you always want to do? What skill do you really want to acquire? Which places do you want to visit? Ask yourself these questions and make a list.
