_The Body in the Dumpster_ is a crime thriller short story that is part of the _Sinners and Secrets_ series. Here's the blurb:

The mangled corpse of a woman is found lying in a dumpster with her eyes scooped out, bones broken and limbs twisted the other way. An honest CB-CID officer Raunak Sharma is put in charge of the case. An exceptionally talented and pretty female reporter, Samaira, follows him, intending to tarnish his reputation through her story. The only way to do that is to make sure that she finds the killer before him. Will she? Who is the killer? Is it the millionaire husband? Or the secretary who has always been jealous of her? Or is it someone she already knew or trusted?
