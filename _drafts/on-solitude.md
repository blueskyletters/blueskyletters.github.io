I never knew I could enjoy

the loneliness so well

I've finally got what I've craved 

for a long time

Everyone's complaining of the closed doors and empty streets

but I feel bliss as I've never felt before

_i love the quietness, the "unbusy" life this tragedy has brought_

Everything seems so at peace, atlast

I can hear the sound of nature loud nad clear

the song of birds not, the horns of vehicles

the blowing of wind not, the hustle of people

For once, everything is calm

I'm at peace with myself,

away from the frolics of life

serenity is here again, 

after a long long time

I will never be bored of this isolation

as it is an isolation from chaos, 

from headache, from stress.

I enjoy my long-craved solitude

My soul has finally got

the solitude it deserved

to refresh, to rejoice

to make the mind at peace again.
