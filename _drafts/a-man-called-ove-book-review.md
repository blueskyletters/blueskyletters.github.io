“We always think there's enough time to do things with other people. Time to say things to them. And then something happens and then we stand there holding on to words like 'if'.”  
― **Fredrik Backman, A Man Called Ove**

I was tempted to pick this book up because of all the good reviews I've seen about it throughout bookstagram; It's definitely not a disappointment.
