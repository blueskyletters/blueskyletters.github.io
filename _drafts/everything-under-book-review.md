_An outstanding read, with a classical myth on its head!_

I picked up this book tempted by its beautiful cover and good reviews (but mostly the cover...), and I'm glad to say that the book turned out to be beautiful on the inside as well!

To begin with, let me say that this book is not a casual read for everyone. Till almost 40% of the book, I did not understand the plot and get the characters; but then things started falling in place.

What's the book about? Well, let's say that it's an eccentric tale of a woman named Gretel and her mother. The book deals with her childhood in the canal boat where they lived. What really scores a goal in this book is that the story is a kind of re-telling of a very popular ancient myth. The author builds this up so skillfully that the reader cannot guess it till the very end. It took me by surprise and I instantly fell in love with the author's writing style.
