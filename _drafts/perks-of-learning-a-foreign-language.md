2. **Multi-tasking Ability**

People who have developed the ability to think in different languages and move from one to the other become much better multi-taskers. Basically, you become more productive and smart.
3\. **Able to make new relations**

The next time you meet a person who speaks the foreign language you've learnt, you can communicate effectively with them. if you are multilingual, you have the advantage of seeing the world from different viewpoints, enhancing your ability to communicate in today’s globally connected world.
4\. **Strengthens Decision Making**

Multilinguals are more confident in their decision-making choices as a result of more practice.
5\. **Opens Up A Wider Career**
