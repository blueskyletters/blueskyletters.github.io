_“Nothing in this world can be hidden or suppressed. All such attempts are like holding an umbrella to conceal the sun.”_

R. K. Narayan is one of the best novelists India has produced. Readers never seem to get enough of the fictional town of Malgudi and its residents. This particular novel is the one that earned Narayan the Sahitya Akademi Award.

_The Guide_ is a typical R. K. Narayan novel , with humor and plot twists and of course the town of Malgudi.
