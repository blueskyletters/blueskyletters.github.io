R. K. Narayan is one of the best novelists India has produced. Readers never seem to get enough of the fictional town of Malgudi and its residents. This particular novel is the one that earned Narayan the Sahitya Akademi Award.

_The Guide_ is a typical R. K. Narayan novel , with humor and plot twists and of course the town of Malgudi. Railway Raju is the protagonist. His meeting with Rosie, a dancer, becomes the turning point in his life. Raju's life is changed drastically from a tourist guide to Rosie's dance manager and later a sage.
