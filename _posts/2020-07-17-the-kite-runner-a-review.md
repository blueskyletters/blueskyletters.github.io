> **_For you, a thousand times over_**

There are some books that tell a story with such intensity that the reader may have the feeling that the story is actually real. Narrating an unforgettable story of friendship, brotherhood, cowardice, sin, redemption, and guilt, Khaled Hosseini's talent as a story-teller is indeed praise worthy. The background of the novel is Afghanisthan in the 1970s-fall of Afghan monarchy, the refugee exodus and the rise of the Taliban.

A coming-of-age story of an Afghan child Amir, The Kite Runner presents the childhood and adulthood of the protagonist with great detail. Both the external turmoil of the land the characters live in and the internal conflict is skillfully expressed. A very unique tale of love and redemption is told with a handful of characters. Every theme of the novel is presented with intense emotions. The friendship between Amir and Hassan is very beautiful; the sin committed and the guilt that Amir experiences is also heart breaking.

What I liked most is the dramatic attempt of Amir to try and rescue an orphan from the cruel antagonist. The whole incident is so intense that I started praying for the  best to happen. In fact, the whole book is filled with such suspenseful incidents, some heart-breaking and some satisfying.

The author plays with every emotion of the reader, making one cry and smile while reading. The book never fails to move our hearts each time we read it. Though a long story giving the minutest of detail, the book grips its readers till the end. Unexpected plot twists and suspense keep the book lively and interesting.

The book is so beautifully summed up that one cannot think of a more perfect ending for this heart-touching novel. 

> _A book that keeps every emotion high like a flying kite...._
