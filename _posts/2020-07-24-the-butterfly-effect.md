_"Every single thing you do matters. You have been created as one of a kind. You have been created in order to make difference. You have within you the power to change the world."_

The theory of the butterfly effect has been made popular through pop culture. It is a phenomenal theory that says about the relevance of minor incidents contributing to greater effects. In chaos theory, the **butterfly effect** is the sensitive dependence on initial conditions in which a small change in one state can result in large differences in a later state. It was initially a mathematical theory applied in weather forecast.

There are some minor things that act as catalysts to some major events. The butterfly theory is metaphorically explained as when a butterfly when flaps its wings will trigger a hurricane in another place. 

More poetically, it signifies the emergence, the inevitable, the resonance between you and and all of us. But we could also just feel, I move my fingers here and you smile there; it is resonance, magical...

While the human race thrives on control and predictability, the butterfly effect shows us that we, in fact, cannot predict the future. The complex universe around us is chaotic and vulnerable to even the smallest of changes. As humans, we can only identify catalysts that react to these conditions. However, if we try to control or predict outcomes, more often than not, it will result in failure.

Many examples exist of instances where a tiny detail led to a dramatic change. In each case, the world we live in could be different if the situation had been reversed. There are many examples for this: the bombing of Nagasaki, the Chernobyl disaster and  numerous other historical events.

In simple words, the butterfly effect means that small alterations can lead to huge changes. This implies the importance of all the little things we do and makes us realise that we have imense potential to change anything, if only we believe that we have the power.
