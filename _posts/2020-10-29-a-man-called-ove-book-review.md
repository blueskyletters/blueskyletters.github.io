“We always think there's enough time to do things with other people. Time to say things to them. And then something happens and then we stand there holding on to words like 'if'.”  
― **Fredrik Backman, A Man Called Ove**

My rating: 5/5

I was tempted to pick this book up because of all the good reviews I've seen about it throughout bookstagram. A Man Called Ove is the kind of book that you should read when you feel skeptical about life.

Ove, a grumpy old man in his forties, believes that he lives in a world where "one becomes outdated before one's time is up". A tale of a grumpy old man and his mundane life... This simple premise may deceive you, but the author weaves a very intricate and charming story filled with wisdom, a bit of philosophical insight, and real-life lessons. 

The book made me laugh at one page and cry at the next. It made me want to be a better person. 

It showed me an optimistic view of life without drawing a curtain to the bad side.

I'm almost sure that this book would be loved by even those who are not much into reading.
