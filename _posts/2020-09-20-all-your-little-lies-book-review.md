Book: All Your Little Lies

Author: Marianne Holmes

Genre: Thriller

Rating: 3/5

The story revolves around the disappearance of a 12-year old child in a small town. Annie, a socially awkward and nervous woman, gets obsessed with this case and wants to help find the girl. What follows are the various consequences and the dark history of Annie's childhood.

The book keeps us interested with its flow. What really spices up the story is the occasional insight into Annie's childhood. The darks incidents really keep us excited. For a thriller, the book was slow-paced. There were unnecessary descriptions and elaborations, which hindered the thrill of the narration. The tension of the incidents is what keeps us turning the pages.
