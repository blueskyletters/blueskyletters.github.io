Do you have any bookish goals apart from the number of books to read in a year and the Goodreads challenge?

Though I have read many books over the years, my reading had been restricted to a few genres. Lately, I had the urge to read books from different genres. Hopefully, this will give a wider perspective and make my reading experience more enjoyable. After experimenting with various genres, I realized that I don't have a favourite category or genre. Also, it nurtures my love for books. I also discovered some new genres such as magical realism, which were really interesting.

Another one of my goals is to read more classics and children's fiction. I really have missed out on many important classics such as Jane Austen's works. So far, this goal is not in much progress. But I hope to improve soon.

I set a goal to read more works written by women and works with female leads. This goal has seen good progress lately. Some of the women authors are Instisar Khanani, Jaishree Misra, Chitra Banerjee, etc. I also started reading memoirs by women, a genre I have avoided for a very long time.

Reading books in your mother tongue is an exceptional experience. Another one of my goals was to read more Malayalam literature. I have been making slow and steady progress in this goal.

Another major challenge I gave myself recently was to strat reading ebooks! I was really opposed to the concept of reading from a screen. I was forced to change this when I ran out of books and it turned out to be good. Ebooks are not that bad, I should say! Now, I mix up my monthly TBR with ebooks along with hardcopies. This is a very convenient method that I have adopted recently.

I have created some templates for genre checklists. You can find them on my Instagram highlights.
