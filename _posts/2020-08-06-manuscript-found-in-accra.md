A treasure of pearls of wisdom from Paulo Coelho

I should say that this book does not have a specific storyline, which came as a disappointment to me because I didn't realize that when buying it. It is actually in the form of a series of questions and answers on extraordinary insights on courage, solitude, loyalty and everyday wisdom.

After lying undiscovered for over 700 years, a manuscript holding the answers to a city's final questions is unearthed. Centuries before, on the eve of the invasion of Accra, the citizens gathered. A man stood before them and invited the people to share their fears, that might offer hope and comfort.

Every line of the book contains deep and meaningful words. This book is actually among one of the most philosophical books I've come across. The topics are simple but the details given are rich with philosophical thinking. For example, about defeat, he says, "Only he who gives up is defeated; everyone else is victorious."  

About solitude, he says, "Solitude is not the absence of Love, but its complement."

On change and adventure he says, "And to those who believe that adventures are dangerous I say, Try routine: that kills you more quickly"

On beauty, he says, "Outer beauty matters because it is the inner beauty visible, and it manifests through the eyes. It doesn't matter if the person is badly dressed or doesn't conform to our idea of elegance."

On true love, he says, "And time will cease to exist because, in the land of true love, everything is infinite."

Since there isn't a storyline, I don't have anything else to say about this book. If you like to read philosophical works that have a lot to ponder over, then I recommend this book.
