A light and fun read  
You might have guessed that the book is based on a love triangle, as the cover hints. An enjoyable story of love, friendship, family, and heartbreaks.  
  
Three youngsters Sidharth, Shreya, and Shivam find their lives intertwined, which leads to some very unexpected circumstances. Narrated through the diary entries of Shiv and Sid, I enjoyed this book, which I'm sure you'll love too if you're a rom-com fan. All the characters including the sub-characters were well developed.  
  
The story is rather predictable after the second half, but I didn't lose interest. I wanted to know what was the fate of this trio. The writing style is simple and elegant.  
  
The story is set mainly in the cities of Delhi and Bangalore. You would enjoy the story particularly if you're from Delhi because there are descriptions of some places in that city.  
  
The diary entries didn't feel realistic as it included too many dialogues. Also, I personally felt that Shreya's point of view could have been added to it.  
  
Pick up this book if you would love a good Bollywood style story!
