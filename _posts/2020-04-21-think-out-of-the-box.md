**Think outside the box, Create outside the box.** 

Almost for everything we do, there is always a conventional way to do it; that is, the formal way to carry out a task and confront a problem. But, even though such methods yield results, they have fewer scope for innovation and no chance for creativity. _"Thinking outside the box"_ is basically a technique to find a new or unconventional way to approach problems and to look at things from a different perspective.

**_Thinking out of the box is the basic concept of creativity._** Creativity is the converting of imaginative ideas into reality. This can only be possible when thoughts are not restricted to just a small space. Instead, you should be able to think widely without any boundaries. **_Limitless imagination and a thirst for new ideas is the key to creativity._**

#### _Why is thinking outside the box so important?_

You may be a conventional person who is comfortable with doing things the old way and it's not bad. But remember that **_Leaders bring up an idea rather than follow them_**. To some, this thinking technique may be a synonym for Risk. Avoiding risks may help you to stay away from mistakes but taking them has much more potential than pushing ourselves into failure. Risks are essential for growth on a personal and business level.

We live in a society where we are programmed to follow the "good old ways". Anything outside the ordinary is considered absurd and face criticisms most of the time. But it is proven that thinking outside the box will surely bring many positives.

Try to **get inspired by famous innovators in your field of work.** Steve Jobs, Da Vinci, Bill Gates, Graham Bell are only just a few people that history has seen to bring marvellous creations into the world.

**Our Experience**

We started our blog last December. We were very confused at the beginning and had many doubts as to whether this blog would reap any benefits. In the end, we understood that **whatever we do in this blog, we do it for the sake of creativity**. Creating new content, as words or illustrations, brings us happiness. **_It is very satisfying to convert our imagination into a virtual reality_**. And it all started from a single thought outside the box.

This **_World Creativity Day_**, what thought have you brought out of the box? Share it with us in the comments below!
