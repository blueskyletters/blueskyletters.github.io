Though  I've turned the pages of many books, I've never rendered a particular character as a favourite. But recently a book just made me fall in love with the most lovable fictional character- Anne of Green Gables.

A children's novel written by Lucy Montgomery in 1908, this book is all one needs for a light reading with a sensible story. I'll try to give a small character sketch about Anne without any spoilers to the story.

Anne of Green Gables is a character far from perfect. She is imperfectly adorable with her cleverness and lively attitude with a deep passion. This novel is written in the early 20th century. But Anne is so unlike the common girl in her times in every aspect. She is brave enough to speak her thoughts. She does not fall into the common fancies that every girl thinks more important like boys and beauty. This is what makes her stand out among her peers and Anne becomes loved by all in Avonlea.

A role model for young girls and a nostalgia-bringer for older readers, Anne is just the most cheerful character ever. That's what makes the novel more than just a children's novel. Every person who had a wonderful childhood close with nature with cheerful friends and abundant imagination finds Anne relatable. Within a few pages of the novel, in Anne's own word, Anne becomes our _"kindred spirit"_.

Anne is an inspiration. She brings out the importance of thoughts in life. She tries to find beauty and happiness in everything around her. She is an ever faithful friend who can love with all her heart. But Anne can also hold a grudge to whom she dislikes, just as she did to Gilbert.

With her firey red hair and freckled face, Anne is far from perfect according to society's beauty concepts. But she proves that beauty is in the heart. Though Anne has vanity at first (which reaches its peak when she accidentally dyes her hair green), she then realizes that beauty of character is much more important than anything else. The author was so sensible in portraying Anne as such during a time when external appearance of ladies mattered more than anything else.

Anne of Green Gables is a strong character. Through Anne, the author puts forward important social issues of the time such as the importance of education of the girl child and economic stability of women. In  short Anne is an all-in-all character.

Beautiful words are sometimes spoken by Anne :

_‚ÄúThat's the worst of growing up, and I'm beginning to realize it. The things you wanted so much when you were a child don't seem half so wonderful to you when you get them.‚Äù_

_‚ÄúNext to trying and winning, the best thing is trying and failing.‚Äù_

_‚ÄúThe world calls them its singers and poets and artists and storytellers; but they are just people who have never forgotten the way to fairyland.‚Äù_

_‚ÄúMy life is a perfect graveyard of buried hopes.‚Äù_

_"Its been my experience that you can nearly always enjoy things if you make up your mind firmly that you will."_
