We know that the world is large. All the 7.8 billion people scattered across the seven continents have diverse cultures, languages and ethics. It makes us wonder how different and unique the mankind is. This awe is usually what drives travelers to wander across the world, curious to explore the different landscapes and human culture.

I'm a person who loves to travel a lot. But, at the same time, I'm also the kind who loves to enjoy the rain alone reading a book in a comfy corner. But if you look at it in another way, I think both of these are the same thing. We travel, taking our physical self into an unknown place: we read taking our mind into an unknown world, sometimes into the past or even future! That's my favorite part of reading-being able to explore places, people, culture and time by sitting in a corner of your room :)

I always try to collect books from different countries. Reading them leaves me pondering on the place, dreaming of the landscapes and wondering about their unique traditions. The Andalusian places from _The Alchemist_, the villages of Nigeria from _Things Fall Apart_, Malgudi from R.K. Narayan's works, Afghanistan from _The Kite Runner,_ 20th century America from _The Great Gatsby....._ The list goes on and on. As for the different cultures, I could write endlessly...

THere are a lot of these kinds of books that I've read and many on my tbr. Here are just a few suggestions and some on my tbr:

* The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini (Afghanistan)
* Country of My Skull _By Antjie Krog (South Africa)_
* Mornings in Jenin by Susan Abulhawa (Palestine)
* Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy (Russia)

I will keep on collecting books from other places. In fact, I have made a list of books from each country and will share it with you all later.
