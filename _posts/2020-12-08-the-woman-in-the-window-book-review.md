A well-crafted psychological thriller...

I picked up _The Woman in the Window_ by A. J Finn when I craved to read a thriller, because of all the hype surrounding it. Though there are some reviews stating that this is a totally overrated book, I did not regret reading it! _The Woman in the Window_ did good justice to the psychological thriller genre.

Here's a short synopsis:

Anna Fox suffers from agoraphobia, an anxiety disorder, and always stays indoors. She spends her time observing her neighbours through the bedroom window. One day, Anna hears a frenzied scream and witnesses something horrible that she shouldn't have seen. She must do everything to uncover the truth. But being an alcoholic and with a very unstable mind, will anyone believe her? Can she even trust herself? 

The suspense element was maximum in the plot. It kept me guessing till the very end! I won't say that the climax was mind-blowing or ground-breaking, but the book was definitely a page-turner. Each twist in the story(there were quite a few!) was more surprising than the previous ones. The book also throws some light on mental health issues, and in some instances, even made me cry. 

It is a very long narration and slow-paced at the beginning, through the PoV of Anna Fox, which is quite unusual for a thriller. But all the incidents mentioned at the beginning are all points that lead to the climax. When the book ends, we understand why the author was so specific about all the details. So, if you pick this book up, I would advise you to not lose faith and keep on reading. I felt that the writing style was very engaging; even Anna's mundane routine did not bore me.

Why I did not give this book a five-star rating is because the concept and premise are not unique, as in _The Silent Patient_ and _Gone Girl_. A lot of books belonging to the psychological thriller genre have the same premise: unreliable female narrators who have unstable personalities and drug/alcohol abuse. So readers who are very familiar with this genre might not be impressed with The Woman in the Window. But as a person who hasn't much reading experience in the thriller genre, I found this book exciting!

The movie adaptation will be out soon. Hoping to watch it!
